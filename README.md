# Tic-Tac-Toe
===================================================================================================================================

## Description

   Tic-tac-toe (or Noughts and crosses, Xs and Os) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The  best play from both parties leads to a draw (often referred to as cat or cat's game).

The simplicity of Tic-tac-toe makes it ideal as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.
